To get this up and running:

# Probably want to setup a local python env:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install python modules
pip install -r requirements.txt

# launch jupyter
jupyter-lab

# now go to the link it shows you
# you should see the jupyter notebooks in your browser
